### C1R1D1 - Apr12 - as good of a start day as any
Made a responsive cardbased design, added some expading funtionality. Will need to switch to proper modal, but later. Next, need to add menu, some design variations. Still next need to take care of server, domains. But first need to massage the design into php, and build some storage backend for it.

### C1R1D2- Apr13

Got a modal mostly working for the individual cards, however columns inside modal are still mess - not working. Well, given time spent almost 3hrs, thats good enough for tonight. R1D2 #100DaysOfCode #100daysofcodechallenge
